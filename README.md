Swganh
=========================
The Swganh Open Source Project's aim is to create a server emulator for the sandbox MMO Star Wars Galaxies at its pre-cu publish 14.1 



Requirements for Building the Core:
=========================
<ul>
<li>A valid Star Wars Galaxies Installation</li>
<li>NetBeans IDE 6.9.1 or higher</li>
<li>java programming</li>
<lijavascript programming</li>
<li>jdk 1.6 or higher</li>
<li>MySQL Server 5.5</li>
<li>TRE Explorer(http://forum.modsource.org/index.php?</li>
<li>Github account</li>
<li>(optional for windows) Github for Windows(http://windows.github.com/)</li>
</ul>
Once you have met the requirements, fork the project(click on the fork button) and then clone your forked repository. If you are using Windows then you can clone the repository with Github for Windows, otherwise you can use the following git command:

git clone https://github.com/your_account_name/shard-of-the-force-reborn.git

Then you can import the project to Netbeans

Contributing and Submitting patches
=========================
To contribute, simply commit your changes to your fork of the project and then submit a pull request here
https://github.com/oswin06082/Swganh/compare/

Now your changes will be reviewed by other developers and once the changes are approved your code will be merged into the main repository.

Please prefix all commits with Added, Changed, Removed or Fixed. If you don't have enough room for multiple changes, use the extended description. Try not to bundle multiple changes into one vague line (ie. "Changed various combat things"). Try to make all commit messages understandable by non-programmers.
